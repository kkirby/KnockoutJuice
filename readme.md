#KnockoutJuice

##Intro
Knockout Juice is intended to bridge the gap in MVC frameworks.
You have Knockout, a robust dependency tracking framework. And then
you have Joose, a wonderful and complete Class design.

I feel no other framework has come close to the functionality
both of these two provide on their own. I have set out to bind
these two together and create a fully functional, simple, MVC
framework.

The methodology behind my intentions is that you shouldn't
reinvent the wheel when there are already great wheels out there.

I hope to incorporate a completely seamless framework that allows
for widgets and view designing along with controller routing and
event tracking.
